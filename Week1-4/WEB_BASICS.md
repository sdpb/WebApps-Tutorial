# In this section I learned how a URL works

Some important definitions.

1. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
2. URL (Uniform Resource Locator)

To do a request from a server we need to introduce
a URL on the top of a browser, it is composed of three sections.

- Protocol: "PROT://"
- Host: "www.WEBSITE.com"
- Document: "/somepage.EXT"

As we can infer there exist a lot of protocols and different types of extensions. 

i.e.

```html
http://www.dr-chuck.com/page1.html
```
